"# Word-search-solver" 

This is a quick Java Project that I did to solve word searches quickly.  
If you pipe in a file with a matrix containing the letters of the word search,
like the one I provided, followed by the words you want to fins on the command line,
the program will print the matrix with the words you entered highlighted.
